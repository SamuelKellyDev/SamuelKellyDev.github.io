			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p style="line-height: 2; width: 50%; size: 50px;">Hi, my name is Sam. I am an aspiring front-end developer with a background in accounting/finance. I have experience working remotely and also as a shift lead within the field of information technology. Prior to this promotion, I worked as an agent and consistently delivered high quality work in a timely manner. In this role, I had to constantly learn how to use new technologies to provide access to customers and simultaneously meet the deadlines of their requests. I believe this experience demonstrates my ability to learn new things quickly as well as solve problems in the context of technology. To elaborate further on my background, computer science wasn't my major in college but I wanted to create a video game which drove me to taking Comp Sci courses for my electives. The specific courses were Intro to Comp Sci as well as Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. When I got my first program working, I knew software development was exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I immediately found the process of writing algorithms and troubleshooting code both fulfilling and challenging. Ultimately, I hope to transition to the field of software development professionally. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I look forward to hearing more from you!</p>
